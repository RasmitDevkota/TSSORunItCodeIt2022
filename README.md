You may [contact us at any time](./README.md#Event-Supervisors) (contact information linked at the bottom) if you need assistance.

### Scoring Rubric

_**Disclaimer:** This competition used an old version of the Scoring Rubric which did not scale points down for the Tasks portion. [Contact an event supervisor](./README.md#Event-Supervisors) (contact information linked at the bottom) for more information._

[RasmitDevkota's Run It Code It Scoring Rubric](https://gist.github.com/DrAlienTech/f97fa4f7a6649ba6dd92d5579251837e)

Points were allocated very generously based on completion of each step of the process, and partial points were awarded to teams who at least attempted a step, even if they didn't code it correctly. Note that the term "step" in this case refers to any non-trivial steps anywhere in the program, not necessarily a line of code or something within one of the tasks. No points were awarded for portions which were not attempted at all.

### Reflection

Based on the feedback given, these tasks were either very challenging or very easy, but took lots of time to implement. The aim with this competition was to provide lots of opportunity for competitors to earn points from various tasks regardless of what they were skilled at, thus why there are 15 tasks. In addition, the tasks were meant to be of varying levels of difficulty (general increasing as you go down the list). Given the mixed feedback thus far and the great disparity among scores, it is practically impossible to gauge how difficult this set of tasks truly was. It was also very difficult to guess how competitiors felt about each task individually as most teams completed a different set of tasks, except for those such as the Palindrome checker and Arithmetic calculator, which many teams completed.

As feedback to competitors, remember that partial credit is always an opportunity! Many teams barely got past the menu, some only coded a single task and gave up afterwards. Even if you aren't sure about something, at least include it in the menu and parse the input and pass it to a bare function. Along with proper style, documentation, and modularity, this would earn plenty of points, which would've helped a lot given how close scores were for those who weren't able to write very much code.

### Feedback Survey

Feedback Survey: [scioly.web.app/feedback/tsso2022-rici](https://scioly.web.app/feedback/tsso2022-rici)

If you competed at this tournament, please consider completing our feedback survey if you have not already! If you did not compete, you are more than welcome to try this test out and fill out the survey afterwards! Constructive feedback helps more than you'd think, so we would really appreciate it if you could take a minute to compete the survey! Who knows, maybe you'll see us again at a future competition with an even better test!

### Special Thanks
Special thanks to [Samyok](https://github.com/samyok) for setting up and letting us use his Run It Code It platform [rici.app](https://rici.app) for this competition! It worked seamlessly and made the entire process much smootherâ€”we definitely couldn't've done it without his help!
